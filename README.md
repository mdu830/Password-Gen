# Password-Generator

This is a simple random password generator written in javascript.
I do NOT recommend this for real security purposes as it is using math.random() and is extremely predictable. 

## Future updates

<li>
  replace math.random() with window.crypto.getRandomValues()
  
  refactor javascript code to be more compact
<li>
