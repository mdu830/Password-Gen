# Password-Generator

This is a simple random password generator written in javascript.
I do NOT recommend this for real security purposes as it is using math.random() and is extremely predictable. 

## Future updates

<li> 
  Replace math.random() with window.crypto.getRandomValues()
   
  Refactor javascript code to be more compact
</li>
